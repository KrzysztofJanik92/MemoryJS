<h1>Memory Game</h1>

Fully responsive <i><b>Extreme Memory Game</b></i> app using:
- javaScript (jQuery)
- Ajax
- PHP

There are three difficulty levels in the game with different number of cards. In addition, 
level 'EXTREME" can perform a maximum of 16 moves before the game is over. For each difficulty level a different look is provided. 
After the game is over the score is recorded in the scoreboard. The best results are visible in the "SCORES" panel.
Because it's all front end tech in action (excluding PHP file) , it should work across all devices, tablets, etc (excluding showing best scores i 'SCORES' panel - You will need to install a local server).

The making of this game was inspired by http://domanart.pl/memory-w-javascript/ but But I've added a lot of changes like 
3 difficulty levels with different look and responsive design.
